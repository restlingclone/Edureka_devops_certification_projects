# DevOps-Certification-Project

This repository includes the Problem Statement, Code Files , Project Implementation report and all other necessary materials required for the creation of complete CI/CD pipeline built as a project for being certified as DevOps Engineer by Edureka.
It was a great learning experience where I learnt at an optimum level about the Devops Tools like Git,Selenium,Puppet,Jenkins,Ansible,Maven,Docker, Kubernetes and Nagios.
Hope this repository helps other in building CI/CD pipeline using the above mentioned tools...
